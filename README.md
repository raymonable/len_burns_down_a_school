99% of credits go to sexxilenx2354 on gamejolt.<br>
thanks for the fun gaem

### > what's the difference between original and this

umm i extracted it and made a few changes so that it works nicely on the interwebz<br>
here's my list of changes:
 - moved index to a seperate directory and now uses another index for simplicity sake
 - fixed aspect ratio
 - added a new title screen
 - added a seperate version of scenarios that i manually replaced or removed swear words from

### > why are there still swears even though i said that i wanted it to be censored

it's likely that the service worker wasn't functioning correctly.<br>
to fix this you'll have to go to devtools, open the `Application` tab,<br>
and unregister the service worker.

(click `Unregister` until it doesn't let you click it.)

then, you can go to main menu and go back in and it should be fixed.<br>
if not, then try reloading until it's fixed, i guess

### > can i embed this on any other sites

well no<br>
1. because i hate it when people do that
2. it's not even my game so why would i get to choose that

loser
